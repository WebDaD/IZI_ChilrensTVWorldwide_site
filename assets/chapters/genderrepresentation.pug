p In the largest ever children’s TV analysis, we tracked gender representation in 19,664 programmes with 26,342 fictional characters from 24 countries. This webpage offers the individual reports of each country as well as a summary of the overall results. The analyses give an overview on the quantitative tendencies in each country. Of course, the results are dependent upon the sample and thus reflect only what was broadcast in May 2007.
